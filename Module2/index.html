                <p>
                    The lean protein in chicken is an excellent source of amino acids. Our bodies use amino acids to build muscle tissue, something that is particularly important as we age. 
                    Studies have also shown that higher protein intake helps to maintain bone mineral density. Eating chicken can help to build stronger muscles.

                <p>
                   Beef is a great dietary source of iron, which helps your red blood cells carry oxygen to the cells throughout your body. Iron is essential for energy, brain function
                   and healthy growth and development, and is particularly important for adolescent girls, pregnant women, menstruating women and endurance athletes.

                <p>
                  Sushi is rich in Omega3 fish oils, which are classed as essential fats, as the body canâ€™t make them. They have a host of health benefits, including reducing high cholesterol levels,
                  the risk of heart disease and overall inflammation, as well as lowering blood pressure, triglycerides and maintaining heart rhythm.
