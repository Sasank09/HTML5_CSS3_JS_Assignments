                            Chicken meat is considered as an easily available source of high-quality protein and other nutrients that are necessary for proper body functioning. In order to meet the consumers’ growing demands for high-quality protein, the poultry industry focused on selection of fast-growing broilers, which reach a body mass of about 2.5 kg within 6-week-intensive fattening. Relatively low sales prices of chicken meat, in comparison to other types of meat, speak in favor of the increased chicken meat consumption. In addition, chicken meat is known by its nutritional quality, as it contains significant amount of high-quality and easily digestible protein and a low portion of saturated fat. Therefore, chicken meat is recommended for consumption by all age groups. The technological parameters of chicken meat quality are related to various factors (keeping conditions, feeding treatment, feed composition, transport, stress before slaughter, etc.). Composition of chicken meat can be influenced through modification of chicken feed composition (addition of different types of oils, vitamins, microelements and amino acids), to produce meat enriched with functional ingredients (n-3 PUFA, carnosine, selenium and vitamin E). By this way, chicken meat becomes a foodstuff with added value, which, in addition to high-quality nutritional composition, also contains ingredients that are beneficial to human health.Indigenous/native breeds of chickens are playing an important role in rural economies in most of the developing and underdeveloped countries. They play a major role for the rural poor and marginalised section of the people with respect to their subsidiary income and also provide them with nutritious chicken egg and meat for their own consumption. Performance of native fowl can be improved by change in husbandry, feeding, and better health cover. However, genetic improvement may be made either through selection and crossbreeding or by utilisation of both selection and crossbreeding. Improvement through selection may be time consuming but the improvement will be permanent. Through crossbreeding improvement may be faster but research has to aim for the production of native-type birds with higher production potential. In the present review efforts have been made to present the importance of native fowl to rural economy and their improvement for higher production performance.

                            Beef is raised and/or eaten in most countries of the world. It’s price and frequency of consumption varies depending on availability. In the US it is readily available and relatively cheap; this is why we eat quite a bit. In other parts of the world like Japan it is difficult to raise due to limited space so it eaten less often and is very expensive. During butchering each animal is divided into large “chunks” called primals. In butcher shops and some high-end restaurants you will find personnel who can butcher a whole side of beef. But in today’s supermarkets you will find people called meat cutters who do not cut beef from the side. They only break down beef from these large primal cuts into fabricated cuts that are sold at the retail level. Each primal yields specific market cuts. As animals move about in the field they exercise their muscles, on a beef the front shoulder area gets a lot of muscle activity. The rear of the animal also gets a lot of movement, but since they walk around forward the front gets more. The most muscle development and consequently the toughest meats, happens in the front legs of the beef. The amount of fat accumulation (which is certainly related to how much activity an animal has had and the type of feed they have been given) determines the grade the animal achieves. The grade determines the price per pound of the animal. The picture shows a piece of Kobe beef with tremendous marbling. The animals “potential” means how the animal can be butchered to yield the most desirable and expensive cuts. As stated, not every market cut can be derived form each beef. For example a butcher cannot yield a new york steaks, fillet mingons and porterhouse steaks from the same animal. Porterhouse steaks are one cut which combines the new york strip and the fillet into one. If an animal has small fillets then they can be sold more lucratively along with the new york in the porterhouse.The beef consumption in the world is causing many problems to the Earth. Beef consumption, if done right, would not be a problem to the Earth, but in reality, many countries are not producing or consuming meat in a way that is not harming this planet. Humans have one thing that we rely on to live and this is called Earth. Humans would seize to exist if this planet was gone but yet many countries keep ignoring the problems they are causing. Choosing to ignore the health issues and the ethic problems is one thing, but in reality ignoring the problem that meat consumption is doing to the Earth is not an option.

It is the popular dishes not only in Japan but also outside of Japan as, Thailand. The history of sushi is interesting. Even if Sushi is one of the representative foods of Japan today, but its origin is found in China around the 4th century. Originally, sushi referred to fermenting fish with salt and rice which was influenced from Thai and Loa farmers. In contrast, sushi in modern times refers to the rice, not the fish. Japanese and Thai have rather same in eating culture because fish and rice is the main ingredients in their dishes. In Thailand, sushi is available in many place such as Japanese restaurant, supermarket or even in fair market because of popularity in all ages. However, some sushi Thai lovers do not know about the types of sushi, the health effect of sushi and eating tip. Sushi has long revolution from the past. In those days, the first type of sushi is called Nare-sushi that the rice was discarded and only the fish meat is eaten. Its fermented time is about 1 to 3 years. After that, during the 15th century, Nama-Nari-sushi was developed. It is not fermented as long as…show more content… Sushi is not only delicious, but it’s also very good for consumers. First, Sushi is low in calories. The most of sea fish have less than 100 calories. Moreover, Oily fish, such as mackerel and sardine are high in omega-3 fatty acids. Second, rice vinegar has amazing antibacterial properties and also lowering the risk of high blood pressure. Third, nori, seaweed, contains with protein, minerals especially iodine and is vitamins A, B1, B2, B6, niacin and C that helps to prevent cholesterol deposits from building up in the blood vessels. In addition, wasabi is rich in vitamin C and it can stimulate the production of saliva and aids digestion.One of the reasons why sushi is so prized is because it is very labour intensive to produce. ... Also, fresh and delicious sushi requires high quality fresh ingredients. Fish that is good enough to be considered 'sushi grade' is very expensive and some of the finest quality fish such as tuna can cost hundreds per pound.
